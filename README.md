
**Getting and Cleaning data**  
=========================


  Copied from the course assignement project instructions:

"The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required to submit: 1) a tidy data set as described below, 2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected."  


##**Files**  


This repo contains 3 files:  

1. The README.md file with the instructions of the assignement and which files the repo contains
2. The run_analysis.R file with the R instructions to perform the tidy_data.txt file
3. The CodeBook.md file with the explanations to know the transformations of the initial data set.
